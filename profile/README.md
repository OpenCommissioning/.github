# Open Commissioning

Open source project for virtual commissioning based on Unity and TwinCAT.
The goal is to provide an open platform for virtual commissioning with PLC (Soft-/Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation).

Here's why:
+ Collaborate and use Knowledge-Sharing Culture
+ Develop state-of-the-art solution for virtual commissioning
+ Avoid vendor lock

# Overview
## 1. Components
The Open Commissioning Project has three main components: 
1. **Unity Package**: Scripts, Tools and Asset for creating virtual model and environment within Unity Editor.
2. **TwinCAT Library**: Pre-built behavior models for actors, sensors and various industrial devices.
3. **Assistant**: This application orchestrates the Unity and TwinCAT sides, and provides an interface for connecting to external industrial systems.
